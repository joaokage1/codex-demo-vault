# Java Secret Manager (Vault-lite)

A minimal, secure, certificate-based secret manager written in **Java**, inspired by HashiCorp Vault.

This project is designed for **single-VM deployments**, accessed via a **CLI**, and secured exclusively using **mutual TLS (mTLS)** and strong cryptography.

## ✨ Features

* 🔐 Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication
* 🧾 Certificate fingerprint–based identity
* 📜 Path-based authorization policies
* 🧠 Envelope encryption (Master Key + DEKs)

## 🔐 Security Model

### Core Principles

* Secrets are **never stored in plaintext**
* Secrets are **never transmitted without TLS**
* Authentication is **certificate-only**
* Authorization is **explicit and deny-by-default**
* The Master Key is **never stored unencrypted**

---

## 🔑 Authentication (mTLS)

* Mutual TLS is enforced on all API endpoints
* Each client uses an **X.509 certificate** issued by a trusted CA
* The server authenticates clients via **certificate fingerprint (SHA-256)**

### Identity

```
client identity = SHA-256 fingerprint of client certificate
```

---

## 📜 Authorization (Policies)

Access is controlled using **path-based policies**, similar to Vault.

### Example Policy

```json
{
  "fingerprint": "9A31F4...",
  "permissions": {
    "read": ["db/prod/*"],
    "write": ["db/staging/*"]
  }
}
```

* Policies are loaded at startup
* Authorization is checked **before any decryption**
* Default behavior is **deny**

---

## 🔒 Cryptography Design

### Envelope Encryption

```
Master Key (MK)
   ↓ encrypts
Data Encryption Key (DEK)
   ↓ encrypts
Secret Value
```

### Algorithms

| Purpose           | Algorithm          |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Secret encryption | AES-256-GCM        |
| Hashing           | SHA-256            |
| Key derivation    | PBKDF2 (or Argon2) |
| Randomness        | SecureRandom       |

---

## 🗝️ Master Key (Unseal Process)

* The server starts in a **sealed** state
* Operator provides a **startup passphrase**
* Passphrase → KDF → Master Key
* Master Key lives **only in memory**
* API remains blocked until unsealed

---

## 💾 Storage

Secrets are stored as encrypted blobs.

### Stored Fields

* Secret path
* Encrypted secret value
* Encrypted DEK
* Version number
* Metadata (timestamps)

### Supported Backends

* SQLite (default)
* PostgreSQL
* File-based storage (early development)

---

## 🌐 API

All endpoints require **mTLS**.

```
PUT    /secrets/{path}
GET    /secrets/{path}
DELETE /secrets/{path}
LIST   /secrets/{path}
```

No sessions, no tokens, no passwords.

---

## 🖥️ CLI

The CLI is a thin Java client responsible for:

* Loading the client certificate (PEM X.509)
* Establishing an mTLS connection
* Sending commands to the server

### Example Commands

```bash
java -cp target/classes com.example.vault.cli.Main \
  put ./secrets.properties db/prod/password "supersecret" \
  "startup-passphrase" ./certs/client-cert.pem ./config/policies.json

java -cp target/classes com.example.vault.cli.Main \
  get ./secrets.properties db/prod/password \
  "startup-passphrase" ./certs/client-cert.pem ./config/policies.json

java -cp target/classes com.example.vault.cli.Main \
  list ./secrets.properties db/prod \
  "startup-passphrase" ./certs/client-cert.pem ./config/policies.json

java -cp target/classes com.example.vault.cli.Main \
  keys ./secrets.properties db/prod \
  "startup-passphrase" ./certs/client-cert.pem ./config/policies.json
```

## 🐳 Docker Compose

Build and run the CLI through Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build
```

### End-to-end example (certificate + policy + put/get)

1. Create a client certificate (self-signed example for local testing):

```bash
mkdir -p ./certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 \
  -keyout ./certs/client-key.pem \
  -out ./certs/client-cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=vault-cli-client"
```

2. Compute the certificate fingerprint that will identify the client:

```bash
CLIENT_FP=$(openssl x509 -in ./certs/client-cert.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha256 \
  | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d ':')
echo "$CLIENT_FP"
```

3. Create a policy file that grants this certificate access to a prefix (example: `db/prod/*`):

```bash
mkdir -p ./config
cat > ./config/policies.json <<EOF
[
  {
    "fingerprint": "${CLIENT_FP}",
    "permissions": {
      "read": ["db/prod/*"],
      "write": ["db/prod/*"]
    }
  }
]
EOF
```

4. Put a secret with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose run --rm vault-cli \
  put ./secrets.properties db/prod/password "supersecret" \
  "startup-passphrase" ./certs/client-cert.pem ./config/policies.json
```

5. Get the secret back:

```bash
docker compose run --rm vault-cli \
  get ./secrets.properties db/prod/password \
  "startup-passphrase" ./certs/client-cert.pem ./config/policies.json
```

Expected output:

```text
supersecret
```

The repository is mounted at `/work` in the container, so local files (store, certs, policies) can be referenced with the same relative paths.

### OpenSSL `ossl_store_handle_load_result:unsupported` troubleshooting

If you see an error like:

```text
error:1608010C:STORE routines:ossl_store_handle_load_result:unsupported
```

you are usually passing a file in the wrong format to an `openssl x509` command.
This project expects a **PEM-encoded X.509 certificate** for client identity
(`client-cert.pem`), not a private key file and not a PKCS#12 (`.p12/.pfx`) bundle.

Quick checks:

```bash
# Confirm the certificate file exists first
ls -l ./certs/client-cert.pem

# Should print certificate details if the file is a PEM certificate
openssl x509 -in ./certs/client-cert.pem -noout -text

# Verify the file actually contains a certificate block
head -n 2 ./certs/client-cert.pem
# Expect: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
```

If `ls` says `No such file or directory`, create the certificate before running
`openssl x509`:

```bash
mkdir -p ./certs
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 \
  -keyout ./certs/client-key.pem \
  -out ./certs/client-cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=vault-cli-client"
```

If you only have a PKCS#12 bundle, extract the certificate first:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in ./certs/client.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out ./certs/client-cert.pem
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Functional

* Valid cert → access allowed
* Invalid or revoked cert → denied
* Unauthorized path → denied

### Security

* Database leak simulation
* MITM attempt test
* Replay attack test
* Rate-limit enforcement

---

## 🛡️ VM Hardening Checklist

* Firewall restricts exposed ports
* SSH key-based login only
* Root login disabled
* TLS 1.2+ enforced
* Strong cipher suites
* Regular OS patching

---

## 🔄 Rotation & Revocation

* Client certificates are rotatable
* Certificate fingerprints can be revoked
* Master Key rotation supported via re-encryption
* DEKs can be re-wrapped without exposing secrets

---

## 🚀 Implementation Order (Recommended)

1. PKI & certificates
2. mTLS server/client
3. Identity extraction
4. Policy enforcement
5. Envelope encryption
6. Storage
7. CLI UX
8. Logging & auditing
9. VM hardening

---

## ⚠️ Non-Goals

* No HA or clustering
* No browser UI
* No dynamic secrets
* No cloud dependency

---

## 📄 License

MIT (or your preferred license)

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

If an attacker:

* Steals the database → secrets remain encrypted
* Sniffs traffic → TLS protects data
* Steals the CLI → useless without cert
* Steals a cert → revoke fingerprint

This provides a **strong, auditable, and understandable security posture** for VM-scoped secret management.

## 🌐 Web SPA (Frontend + Backend API)

This repository now includes a modern SPA for managing secrets.

### UI features

- Upload client certificate (`.pem`) and policy file (`.json`)
- Provide unseal passphrase
- Menu tabs for:
  - Put Secret
  - Retrieve Secret
  - List Secrets

### Start UI + API with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build -d vault-backend vault-frontend
```

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- API health: `http://localhost:8080/api/health`

### Start only the frontend app (Docker)

If your backend API is already running separately, start only the UI service:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d vault-frontend
```

### Start only the frontend app (without Docker)

You can also run the SPA as static files for development:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 3000 --directory frontend
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

The SPA calls the backend API at `http://localhost:8080/api` by default.
